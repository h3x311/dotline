content: "Recently I live alone, when I woke up, I used to check some msg of mail or whatever other stuff related to job, when I got no feedback, always felt void, then chose to read some shit social media to make me 'happy', but TBH, it just made everything worse, like I need to spend more than 1 hour to get up, what it means this will waste my precious morning time that could change something, and those social shits just meaningless which led to meaningless emotion. As a human-being, I need to take care of my self and surroundings to make a nice environment to grow up my mindset, ok...that's all. I will do something now..I will try to control this, caused life is too short, and I need to explore and extend it, don't wanna let those shit to waste my time and life"
