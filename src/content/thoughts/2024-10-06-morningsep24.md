content: "Recently I live alone, when I woke up, I used to check some msg of mail or whatever other stuff related to job, when I got no feedback, always felt void, then chose to read some shit social media to make me 'happy', but TBH, it just made everything worse, like I need to spend more than 1 hour to get up, what it means is this will waste my precious morning time that could change something, and those social shits just meaningless which led to meaningless emotion. In the long term, this will even decrease my ability of cognitive and truly feelings aka awareness of objective things. As a human-being, I need to take care of my self and surroundings(similar to self-responsibility, caused cognitive-action gap aka a bug in brain, sometimes even felt guilty of this process, I knew it, but I can't do it rightly) to make a nice environment to grow up my mindset, ok...that's all. I will do something now..I will try to control this, caused life is too short, and I need to explore and extend it, don't wanna let those shit to waste my time and life. And there will be another nice day?"
