# Preface

I try to let myself know how to consume the limited life and be brave to lose nothing that I have, this could be a choice filter help me find new innovative things that I missed, and stay away with useless. Caused I know sometimes I will make non-reasonable decisions based on emotional, this could be a reminder.

It involves learn, health, and work, tools
