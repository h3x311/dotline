## Table of contents

# Job hunting

active hunting, negotiation, trying

# Plan

FE is most important one, SD is very tricky one which means I need more time to prepare in the end, Algs go through with whole process, its important to cover all important patterns, BQ I never prepare of this part

## Update
I thought most hard part is still tech test, no matter FE or LC, try more mocks!

# Mock Interview
could be a good tool to check FE/Algs/BQ

## updates
I'll do more mocks until I feel comfortable with everything.

# FE

FE includes JS, React, CSS, HTML and some quiz.
- Enhance HTML CSS React is easy but important.
- And for the js basic, need to be concluded and read some YDKJS.
- Read some quiz when I am not busy.

1. CSS
2. Quiz
3. JS videos or books

## Updates

Recently, I quickly reviewed many quiz and GFE QA for zoom interview, I feel fullfilled, but still long way to go.

# SD

SD is really hard to face it. caused it included so much details.

SD includes diff patterns.

Still need to go through and highlight, conclude, need some times to prep.

then practice with new instances.

Update: I thought its not really hard to cover the basic.

# Algs

Review and validate level is a pain. Can't find suitable time to review those and validate it.
Maybe use pramp is a way to check it. quick fail quick fix.

## NOTE
- firstly, introduction
- discuss with question
- and solution
  - 从最直观的来分析，逐渐到最优解
- abstract solution into small func
- use suitable ds(如何选择？为什么选择？)

## Update

I thought Algs need mock and test until you feel comfortable with the real one. more than practice.

# BQ

Read the [guide](https://www.designgurus.io/course-play/grokking-behavioral-interview/doc/6415b3fd6f3b018367901cdb), then practice, no other ways

- I am actually feel free about BQ
