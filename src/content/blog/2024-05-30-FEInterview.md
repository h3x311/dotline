# Preface

Including FE, Algs, SD, BQ

# Plan

FE is most important one, SD is very tricky one which means I need more time to prepare in the end, Algs go through with whole process, its important to cover all important patterns, BQ I never prepare of this part

# Mock Interview
could be a good tool to check FE/Algs/BQ

# FE

FE includes JS, React, CSS, HTML and some quiz.
- Enhance HTML CSS React is easy but important.
- And for the js basic, need to be concluded and read some YDKJS.
- Read some quiz when I am not busy.

# SD

SD is really hard to face it. caused it included so much details.

SD includes diff patterns.

Still need to go through and highlight, conclude, need some times to prep.

then practice with new instances.

# Algs

Review and validate level is a pain. Can't find suitable time to review those and validate it.
Maybe use pramp is a way to check it. quick fail quick fix.

# BQ

Read the [guide](https://www.designgurus.io/course-play/grokking-behavioral-interview/doc/6415b3fd6f3b018367901cdb), then practice, no other ways
