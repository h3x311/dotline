  "不同的面 好的 坏的 颜色各异 方向各异"

**不同的面 好的 坏的 颜色各异 方向各异**
*不同的面反弹不同的话语*
* You’re not a monster you’re just someone who needs help.
* Stimulation will obtain a short period of physical pleasure.
* I am just a person, not the world itself.
* I need to focus on things outside of myself so that I don't get anxious.
* After giving up, I will be free and relaxed.
* I will die, and time never stops.

* Past life is so sick. And I can't have an idea for fun when I am in depression. I have no ability to live. Just wanna kill everything. I know the dark is drowning me. And when dark disappears, I will become a monster, I am afraid of myself. I know it's not a big deal. But my heart is broken in the past time, I can't find a way to fix it. I hate myself of a monster. I hate dark. But I don't see and feel the light.
* Maybe I am too afraid of death and darkness. Whatever, I can't be anyone else. I just be a monster. And always.
* I resist darkness with darkness, and darkness becomes a part of me.
* But I don't have the ability to control my dark emotions. Instead, they control me to become anxious and hateful.
* If I can be free and relaxed in real life, maybe I will stick to live.

1. If I failed one by one, should I continue or give up life?
2. I will seek help again and fall into dark again, but these experience will make me better and have more courage to face real life and hardness.
