# Preface

I feel sick about editing the resume, and I'll try to conclude a more general way for resume/linkedin prep.

I think there are 2 important things, one is for the requirements, another is experience's quality which can show the value you have, and you can get deeper in the interview. 

Anyway, it's super crucial to master one domain so you can show off in the interview, which means this domain is difficult and complex and deep to learn. Even you can have some defects on others.

# Overall

I got templates from [faangtechleads](https://www.faangtechleads.com/), and try to get some reviews by others in discord, Finally, I made one that I think it's good enough to use it, I'll end with resume hell.

# Requirements

- [filter the jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3641478664&distance=25&f_WT=2&geoId=91000000&keywords=frontend%20developer&origin=JOB_SEARCH_PAGE_KEYWORD_HISTORY&refresh=true&start=25) in linkedin
- use [word cloud](https://wordart.com/create) to visualize the percentage.
  - take frontend for example:
    - ![eE8xGttest](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/h3x311/upic@main/LC3/2024/eE8xGttest.jpg)
- then we could use these keywords and gpt to generate a suitable simple intro for the requirements.

# Introduction

> I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at xx because I believe with my experience, I could bring some significant contributions to your team.

# Experience

Actually, I picked some main projects and use some numbers, XYZ to refactored it, for my own project, it's much easier caused I know what I have done with it.

# Projects

According to above, we need some frontend to show the skills of it, then some fullstack to show we understand backend. And try to write some clean code with good comments to have better reading experience, good UIUX experience. Or even make some SEO and performance optimization. Simple and clean.
