**hi, I am sober from the virtual world. Today is 20210505. Now is 20:34. It's the first day of time machine. Welcome to the time machine journey with me.**
:)

> 时间是虚无的，它不存在，标记着发展。
> 重复着日夜，开始结束。
> 同样的惊喜和希望，
> 同样的痛苦和悲伤。
> 递归的迭代，无尽。

> 做喜欢的事很拼命的人一定懂得等价交换。生命是消耗品，有些人以为消耗品是用不尽的，直到死亡。不过，这本就是自然规律，刻意计算成本，反而失去身为人的众多体验。生命只有一次，你要用来做什么呢？

惟静默，生言语，
惟黑暗，成光明，
惟死亡，得再生,
鹰扬虚空，灿兮明兮

> Only in silence the word,
> only in dark the light,
> only in dying life:
> bright the hawk's flight
> on the empty sky.

> You were young, and you thought the wizard could do anything. So did we all, once. But the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do... I was too impatient. I wanted the sun and the cities and the far lands, too much to pay for a little power, a shadow, and a darkness.

> 你还年幼,以为法师无所不能。我以前也这么认为。我们每个人都曾经有那种想法。但事实是,一个人其正的力量若增强,知识若拓宽,他得以依循的路途反而变窄。到最后他什麼也不挑栋,只能全心人事必须做的事。以前我太心急,现在才会没有多余的时间。我把心中盼望的阳光、城市、遥远的异域,都拿去换一丁点カ量、一个黑影、还有黑暗了。

> Be without fear
> in the face of your enemies.
> Be brave and upright
> that God may love thee.
> Speak the truth
> even if it leads to your death.
> Safeguard the helpless.

> holiness…is in right action.And courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves.
> And goodness…what God desires…is here(mind) and here(heart).
> By what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man…or not.
